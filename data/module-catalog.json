It is divided into two parts: a largely practical part that gives an overview of shared memory concurrency in modern programming languages, and a more theoretical part that treats shared memory concurrency from the ground up, covering low-level topics such as hardware memory models, primitives for shared-memory concurrency, building up towards higher-level synchronisation techniques such as locks, mutexes and transactional memory. Throughout the course, a main objective is to reinforce correct concurrent programming through the use of tools, formal specification and verification techniques.",

This will include the foundations of blockchains, smart-contract programming, and decentralised application development. (There are no strict prerequisites to take this module. However, this module does not cover general programming concepts, and it is assumed that students are familiar with these. While this module does cover some decentralised finance applications in some lectures, no previous knowledge of finance is required.)",

      "description": "The course will provide you with an introduction to the areas of classical and probabilistic program analysis. Starting from methods used in compiler optimisation (Live Variable, etc.) you will be introduced to lattice based approaches to Data-flow Analysis (Monotone Frameworks) and Control-flow Analysis before we discuss the general, semantics based framework of Abstract Interpretation. Considering quantitative properties of (probabilistic) programs you will then see how to extend classical program analysis to this setting. This leads to a framework of Probabilistic Abstract Interpretation which is based to an appropriate formal semantics.",

      "description": "Software verification has come of age: proof assistants are mature; verification techniques and tools are tractable; and real-world programs are verified both in academia and industry. A key breakthrough came with separation logic, which introduced compositional reasoning about heap-manipulating programs. The aim of this course is to enable students to reason about heap-manipulating programs using separation logic, both by exploring the underlying theory and by working with cutting-edge academic and industrial analysis tools. The fact that the reasoning is compositional means that it scales. The theoretical part of the course will revolve around a simple While language, whereas the practical part will touch on real-world languages such as Java, JavaScript and C. More specifically, you will: gain an in-depth understanding of the theory underpinning separation logic, why it works and why it is correct; use separation logic to specify and verify sequential programs, focusing on standard data structures and their operations; learn about the academic and industrial tools based on separation logic; gain basic familiarity with concurrent separation logics, in particular their theory and their application to concurrent data-structure algorithms. Recommended pre-requisites: for the M.Eng students, an interest in COMP40018 Discrete Mathematics, Logic and Reasoning, (JMC: COMP40012 Logic and Reasoning), COMP50003 Models of Computation (the part on semantics); for the MSc students, either some experience in formal reasoning about programs or rigorous programming skills or a good knowledge of algorithms and a strength in mathematics.",

This course covers tabular and deep reinforcement learning topics and couples classical and modern approaches to provide students with a unified understanding of how RL algorithms have evolved and are applied today. Students will develop three core skills: theory, implementation, and evaluation. The module follows a \"\"roots-to-modern\"\" structure where each major algorithmic family (model-free, model-based, etc) is explored from its tabular origins through to contemporary deep learning implementations. By mid-course, students will be equipped to understand and critically evaluate modern RL research papers. Specifically, you will: * Master the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning (MDPs, dynamic programming, and convergence guarantees) * Trace the evolution of model-free methods from temporal difference learning to Deep Q-Networks and beyond * Understand policy-based approaches from REINFORCE to modern actor-critic methods like SAC and PPO * Explore model-based RL from classical planning to modern neural approaches * Implement and experiment with both classical and deep RL algorithms using Python and PyTorch * Develop skills in performance evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and algorithmic comparison * Critically analyze current RL research and identify future directions",

      "title": "Formal Methods for Safe AI",
      "description": "The overall aim of this module is to provide an overview of current applications of formal methods to modern AI systems, including the verification, certification, and monitoring of agent-based systems and solutions. You will develop intellectual and practical skills in the use of formal methods, including temporal languages, for knowledge representation and automated reasoning in Artificial Intelligence. This module is structured in four parts. The first part focuses on basic modal logic, its syntax and semantics based on Kripke frames and models, as well as the model theory of modal logic, including the notions of satisfaction and validity. The second part will give you the foundations for the specification of strategic behaviours of agents in multi-agent systems (MAS), including the formalism of Concurrent Game Structures as a mathematical representation of MAS. We will then introduce Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) and Computation-tree Temporal Logic (CTL) as languages to represent and reason about safety, reachability, and other interesting properties of MAS. In particular, we will present algorithm to solve the model checking problem for both LTL and CTL, thus allowing for the verification of MAS. In the third part we will consider the role played by formal methods in modern AI systems, specifically reinforcement learning (RL). We will see how reward shaping and synthesis from temporal specifications can help solving the problem of reward (mis-)specification in RL. Finally, in the fourth part, we will introduce the language of Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL), an extension of the temporal logics CTL and LTL, which will allow you to express game-theoretical notions such as the existence of a winning strategy for a group of agents. You will analyse the various assumptions that can be made about the reasoning capabilities of autonomous agents: agents can have perfect observability on the environment in which they are interacting with the other agents, or they might only have partial observability; they might remember all the sequence of events leading to their current state, or their memory might be limited in some way. You will learn the consequences, in terms of valid/satisfiable formulas, of these modelling assumptions; and you will learn in what cases these different modeling choices are appropriate given a particular MAS scenario. You will also see how the complexity of the model checking problem for ATL depends on these modeling choices. Model checking algorithms will be illustrated for all cases in which the problem is decidable, while undecidable cases will also be explained briefly.",

      "description": "Robot Learning is an exciting new field, which studies how physical robots can learn skills using machine learning techniques, and can be seen as an \"advanced reinforcement learning\" module. The module first motivates the need for robot learning, by describing classical robot control methods and their limitations. Then, the module explains how reinforcement learning can be applied to physical robots acting in the real world. Finally, the module explores how robots can learn new skills by observing and interacting with humans. Lab sessions and courseworks teach students how to implement these methods in Python for a simulated robot learning to solve tasks, which culminates in a fun live competition in the final lecture. The module assumes knowledge of the Reinforcement Learning module in the previous term, so taking Reinforcement Learning is strongly recommended, unless students have already taken a similar module elsewhere. For example, the module assumes familiarity with Markov decision processes, Q-learning, and deep reinforcement learning, although these will be briefly recapped",

Throughout the module, you will learn the basic principles behind the brain's intelligent behaviour, the computational tools needed to simulate such behaviour, and illuminating connections between biological and artificial intelligent systems.

This module will introduce the basics of information theory as devised by Claude Shannon in 1948, and then delve into its deep connections with statistics and machine learning. Through mathematical and computational exercises, the module presents information as a unifying theory linking computing, statistics, and geomety, and provides crucial theoretical background for students wishing to pursue a career in data science or machine learning.",

Next, the module covers the nascent field of graph neural networks on both theoretical and application levels. Together, we will explore the foundation of landmark GNN models and cover state-of-the-art models and graph-based learning techniques. We will have sessions to implement a few GNN examples in Python, weekly quizzes for continuous assessment, and stimulating group discussions based on deconstructing recent papers published in this field.",

This Kantian empirical realism called experience is made possible by the a priori Euclidean constraints on space. While being subject to limits of scales and tolerances of our senses, such a flat view of the world has been the driving force in many fields laying the foundations of the first AI systems. Recent progress is challenging this perspective by showing that the world around us as well as the answers we are looking for admit a non-Euclidean, curved structure. Hence, it becomes desirable for our machine learning models to adapt naturally. In this course, we cover the nuts and bolts of learning non- Euclidean embeddings connecting non-Euclidean domains and parameter spaces. We will apply optimization techniques from Riemannian geometry, bring in knowledge from graph theory and present novel developments in neural networks that are suited to data living on lower dimensional manifolds.",
